  <p>Heroes Replay Statistics Browser is an app designed to help you better analyse your Heroes of the Storm games. While many
    sites offer meta analysis of replays few dive deep into individual games.</p>
  <p>The app parses and analyses the replays 100% in the browser. No server required(except to serve the static files)</p>
